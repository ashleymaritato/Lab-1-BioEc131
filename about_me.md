Hi, my name is Ashley Maritato and I am a junior at Berkeley. 
I initially started as a Chemical Engineering major, but I am switching into Genetics and Plant Biology with a minor in bioengineering.
Currently I work at CVS Pharmacy as a pharmacy technician and I am interested in pharmaceutical and biomedical research, so I am hoping to get some good computational biology experience in this class!
